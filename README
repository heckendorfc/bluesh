bluesh -- an interactive command interpreter (shell)
------

Line editing commands:
	left    -- Move cursor to the left
	right   -- Move cursor to the right
	^[^     -- Move cursor to start of line
	^[$     -- Move cursor to end of line
	^I      -- Complete filename
	^V      -- Insert next character literally
	^P      -- Complete command using older history
	^N      -- Complete command using more recent history
	up      -- Navigate to older in history
	down    -- Navigate to more recent in history

Variables:
	set name=value
	${name}

Loops:
	for [variable] in [list] { [commands] }
	while [pipeline] { [commands] }

	note: [list] must be given as a single word
	             (quote enclosed or whitespace escaped)
	      [commands] should be terminated with ; or &
	      [pipeline] may be a single command but should not be
	             terminated with ; or &. Only the return
	             value of the final command in the pipeline
	             is tested.
Command substitution:
	command `substituted commands`

Builtin commands:
